# Timer
A simple GNOME extension that provides a panel timer with an alarm sound notification.

ðŸ‘‰ **Download from GNOME Extensions:** [Timer on GNOME Extensions](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/7858/timer/)

## Features
- **Single time units**: Use simple time formats like `1h`, `1m`, or `1s`.
- **Multiple time units**: Combine units, such as `1h 30m`, `1m 25s`, or `1h 20m 30s`.
- **Repetitions**: Use `repX` (e.g., `rep3` for 3 repetitions).
- **Rest time**: Use `restX` with time units (`h`, `m`, `s`) like `rest1h`, `rest1m`, `rest30s`.
- **Combining Units**:
  You can combine the following units to create a custom timer. For example:
  - `2s rep3 rest1m` = 2 seconds of work time, 3 repetitions, and 1 minute of rest between repetitions.
  - `1m rep5 rest30s` = 1 minute of work time, 5 repetitions, and 30 seconds of rest after each rep.

## Planned Improvements
Here are some upcoming features and improvements that will be added in future updates:
- **Error Handling for Time Format**: Users will be notified with a message like "Invalid time format" if they input an incorrect format.
- **Customizable Alarm Sound**: Allow users to choose their own alarm sound or use a system default.
- **Visual Timer Display**: Add a visual progress bar or countdown to make it more engaging, in addition to the timer updating in the menu.
- **Repetition Feedback**: Show a progress indicator for repetitions, such as "Rep 1/5" or a simple progress bar
- **History**: Users will be able to view and reuse the last 5 timers they have set, making it easy to repeat common time setups.
- **Different sounds**: Add two new sounds - one to break rest mode and one to start rest mode.
- **Refactor the whole mess I made on the code**

## Usage
ðŸ“¥ **Download:** You can install the extension directly from the [GNOME Extensions website](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/7858/timer/).
